# Weather App - Features Overview

This repository contains a Weather App with two distinct implementations: a functional-based version using React Hooks, and a class-based version showcasing traditional React component architecture. The app fetches and displays weather information based on user input, demonstrating modern React practices and efficient API integration. Here are the key features:

## Functional-Based Implementation (src/App.js):

React Hooks: Utilizes useState and useEffect for state management and handling side effects.
Dynamic Weather Data Fetching: Fetches real-time weather information from the Open Meteo API based on user input.
AbortController: Implements AbortController for canceling fetch requests to prevent race conditions.
Error Handling: Includes error handling to display user-friendly error messages.


## Class-Based Implementation (src/ClassBased_Weather_App.js):

Class-Based Components: Traditional React class-based components.
Lifecycle Methods: Manages component lifecycle for data fetching and updates.
State Management: Robust state management using class component state.
Error Handling: Error handling to manage and display errors effectively.
Shared Features:
Input Component: Allows users to search for weather information by location.
Weather Display: Elegantly displays weather data including temperatures, weather codes, and location flags.
Code Reusability: Demonstrates the use of utility functions for common tasks like weather icon mapping and country flag conversion.
